2. **Brief Summary**: The first line of the commit message should serve as a brief summary of the changes. It should be succinct yet informative, providing enough detail to understand the nature of the changes at a glance.

3. **Detailed Explanation**: Following the summary, you can include a more detailed explanation of the changes, if necessary. This can include information about why the changes were made, any related issues or tasks, and any otfher relevant context.

4. **Keep Lines Short**: Try to keep each line of the commit message to a maximum of 72-80 characters. This makes the message easier to read in various Git tools and command-line interfaces.

5. **Use Imperative Mood**: Write commit messages in the imperative mood, such as "Fix bug" or "Add feature". This convention helps maintain consistency and clarity across commit messages.

6. **Separate Header and Body**: If your commit message requires a detailed explanation, separate the header (summary) from the body (explanation) with a blank line. This improves readability and organization.

Here's an example of a well-formatted commit message:
